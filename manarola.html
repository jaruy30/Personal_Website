First of all, Manarola is well known for its beautiful coastline, which can be seen by the vibrant homes that are frighteningly located on high cliffs with views of the sparkling Ligurian Sea. Being a passionate enthusiast of scenic landscapes and the beauty of the natural world, I find it very fascinating to have the chance to see these incredible sights up close.

                  Furthermore, Manarola has a rich cultural and historical background, having its roots in the Middle Ages. I would get a wonderful look into Italy's rich history and architectural wonders by strolling through the village's lovely little alleyways. Every area of Manarola, from historic cathedrals to lovely streets, promises to tell a story and provide a unique mix of tradition and modernity</p>
