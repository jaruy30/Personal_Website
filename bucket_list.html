                <p style="margin-top: -80px; margin-left: 475px; margin-bottom: -25px; font-size:x-large;">Learn and Speak Spanish</p><br>

                <p style="font-weight: lighter; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 80px;">Learning Spanish has been a longstanding aspiration of mine. The richness of the language and its prevalence globally have always fascinated me. By mastering Spanish, I not only aim to broaden my communication skills but also to immerse myself in the diverse cultures where it's spoken. Being able to converse fluently in Spanish would not only enhance my personal experiences while traveling but also open up new opportunities for me in various aspects of life.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: lighter; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 80px;">Shooting a live firearm is an experience that I approach with a mix of curiosity, respect, and a desire to learn.
