Located close to Luxor on the western bank of the Nile River, this ancient site is filled with fascinating archeological finds that need to be discovered. The site's closeness to the Nile River adds to its attraction, providing beautiful views of the surroundings and serves as a reminder of the river's importance to ancient Egyptian society.

                  Basically, I'm really fascinated by the history, architecture, and culture of ancient Egypt, which is why I want to travel to Deir el-Bahari. It offers a chance to explore the past, solve the puzzles of an antiquated society, and develop a greater respect for the wonders of human accomplishment.</p>
